# Chang Chen
My name is Chang Chen and I am a senior in Biometry & Statistics.   
I took Computational Genetics & Genomics last semester and became interested in numerous applications of Bayesian approaches in sequencing alignment, hidden state detection, and phylogenetic tree building.   
For example, given multiple DNA sequences, we can obtain posterior probability of high GC content at each locus through Bayesian method.
